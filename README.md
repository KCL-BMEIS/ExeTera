ExeTera

Welcome to the ExeTera Readme!
This page and the accompanying github wiki show you how to make use of ExeTera to create reproducible
analysis pipelines for large tabular datasets.

# Usage

The ExeTera allows you to import data from CSV sources into HDF5, a columnar data
format more suited to performing analytics. This is done through `exetera import`.


### `exetera import`
```
exetera import
-s path/to/covid_schema.json \
-i "patients:path/to/patient_data.csv, assessments:path/to/assessmentdata.csv, tests:path/to/covid_test_data.csv, diet:path/to/diet_study_data.csv" \
-o /path/to/output_dataset_name.hdf5
```


#### Arguments
 * `-s/--schema`: The location and name of the schema file
 * `-te/--territories`: If set, this only imports the listed territories. If left unset, all
   territories are imported
 * `-i/--inputs` : A comma separated list of 'name:file' pairs. This should be put in parentheses if it contains any
  whitespace. See the example above.
 * `-o/--output_hdf5`: The path and name to where the resulting hdf5 dataset should be written
 * `-ts/--timestamp`: An override for the timestamp to be written
   (defaults to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`)
 * `-w/--overwrite`: If set, overwrite any existing dataset with the same name; appends to existing dataset otherwise
 
Expect this script to take about an hour or more to execute on very large datasets.


## How do I work on the resulting dataset?
This is done through the python `exetera` API.

```python
from exetera.core.session import Session

with Session() as s:
    src = s.open_dataset('/path/to/my/source/dataset', 'r', 'src')
    dest = s.open_dataset('/path/to/my/result/dataset', 'w', 'dest')

    # code...
```


See the wiki for detailed examples of how to interact with the hdf5 datastore.


## Changes

### v0.3.2 -> v0.4

* Separation of all covid-specific functionality out to [https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/ExeTeraCovid.git](https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/ExeTeraCovid.git)
* Removal of legacy csv pipeline code
* Renaming of some of the `ordered_merge_*` functionality parameters for clarity
* Addition of `open/close/list/get_dataset` functionality to `Session`
* Made `Session` 'withable'
* Improved performance of `Session.get_spans`
* Bug fixes for Session API
  * apply_spans / aggregation issues
* Bug fixes for Field API
  * provided `__bool__` so that `if field:` works as expected
  * provided single element read for `IndexedStringField`


### v0.3.1 -> v0.3.2
* Fixing issues with use of test_type_from_mechanism_v1
* Adding ability to optionally import lsoa-based fields through add_imd script
* Import now appends by default; to overwrite an existing dataset use `-w` \ `--overwrite`
* Moved schema files to resources
* Adding separate lsoa schema for import

### v0.3.0 -> v0.3.1
* Major performance improvement to Session.get_spans

### v0.2.7 -> v0.3.0
* Renaming of hystore to ExeTera, the project's new name!
* Renaming of the `hystorex` command to `exetera`
* Removal of scripts that now belong in https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/ExeTeraCovid.git
* Addition of snapshot journaling and extremely large sort functionality
* Removal of the legacy csv script functionality

### v0.2.7 -> v0.2.7.3
* Fix to covid_schema.json for numeric diet fields marked 'float' instead of 'float32'
* Addition of --daily flag to enable / disable generation of daily assessments
* Addition of 

### v0.2.6 -> v0.2.7
* Addition of diet questionnaire schema
* Reworking of arguments for hystorex import to support arbitrary numbers and names of csvs
* Provision of highly-scalable merge functionality through ordered merge functions
  * Fix for filtering of indexed string fields

### v0.2.5 -> v0.2.6
* Moving from DataSet to Session class offering cleaner syntax
* Moving from Readers/Writers to Fields for cleaner syntax
* Introduction of schema for import command
* Consolidating commands
  * h5import -> hystorex import
  * h5process -> hystorex process

### v0.2.3 -> v0.2.5
* Please note: there was no version v0.2.4; due to a numbering error when updating the version number
* Simplifications to the API

### v0.2.2 -> v0.2.3
* Data schema updated for 1.5.1

### v0.2.1 -> v0.2.2
* Fix: Split functionality had not been moved to bin/csvsplit as documented
* Fix: Missing license headers added

### v0.2.0 -> v0.2.1 - tag
* Refactor: Created the `DataStore` class and moved `processor` api methods onto it as member
  functions
* Refactor: Simplified the creation of Writers. This can now be done through `get_writer` on
  a `DataStore` instance
* Fix: Writes to a hdf5 store can no longer be interrupted by interrupts, resulting in more
  stable hdf5 files
* Fix: Fixed critical bug in process method that resulted in exceptions when running on fields
  with a length that isn't an exact multiple of the chunksize

### v0.1.9 -> v0.2.0
* Added hdf5 import and process functionality

### v0.1.8 -> v0.1.9
* Feature: provision of the `split.py` script to split the dataset up into subsets of patients
  and their associated assessments
* Fix: added `treatments` and `other_symptoms` to cleaned assessment file. These fields are
  concatenated during the merge step using using csv-style delimiters and escapes

### v0.1.7 -> v0.1.8
* Fix: `had_covid_test` was not being patched up along with `tested_covid_positive`'
* Breaking change: output fields renamed
  * Fixed up `had_covid_test` is output as `had_covid_test_clean`
  * Fixed up `tested_covid_positive` is output as `tested_covid_positive_clean`
  * `had_covid_test` and `tested_covid_positive` contain the un-fixed-up data (although rows may
    still be modified as a result of quantising assessments by day)

### v0.1.6 -> v0.1.7
* Fix: `height_clean` contains weight data and `weight_clean` contains height data.
  This has been the case since they were introduced in v0.1.5

### v0.1.5 -> v0.1.6
* Performance: reduced memory usage
* Addition: provision of `-ps` flag for setting parsing schema

### v0.1.4 -> v0.1.5
* Fix: `health_status` was not being accumulated during the assessment compression phase of cleanup

### v0.1.3 -> v0.1.4
* Fix: added missing value `rarely_left_the_house_but_visit_lots` to `level_of_isolation`
* Fix: added missing fields `weight_clean`, `height_clean` and `bmi_clean`

### v0.1.2 -> v0.1.3
* Fix: `-po` and `-ao` options now properly export patient and assessment csvs respectively

### v0.1.1 -> v0.1.2
* Fix: `day` no longer overwriting `tested_covid_positive` on assessment export
* Fix: `tested_covid_positive` output as a label instead of a number

### v0.1 -> v0.1.1
* Change: Converted `'NA'` to `''` for csv export
